# Higher Education Compared to Salaries
## Project 1 - Team 5

### The purpose of this project was to research if attending a private vs. non-private university/college could result in a higher income after graduating. We used Python as a programming language and Pandas and Microsoft Excel for data manipulation.

### Write-up of Findings

•	What’s the best university to attend for a higher starting & mid-career salary?
We found that the best university to attend for the highest starting salary was California Institute of Technology (CIT) with the average entry-level being $75,500 and cost of being $58,755. The lowest starting salary was from Villanova with an expected entry-level salary of $55,800 and the cost of tuition being $58,736.

•	Which private & non-private universities have the highest earning potential.
As it relates to early-career salary, the top three higher earning salaries come from:
   • Early Career Salary (0-5 Years):
     • Private:
       • Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - $81,500
       • Harvey Mudd College - $81,000
       • California Institute of Technology (CIT) - $78,800
     • Non-private
       • Colorado School of Mines - $71,900
       • UC Berkeley - $65,400
       • Virginia Military Institute - $62,200
   • Mid-Career Salary (5+ Years)
     • Private
       • $62,200 - $155,800
       • Princeton University - $147,800
       • Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - $147,000
     • Non-private
       • Colorado School of Mines - $136,100
       • UC Berkeley - $130,100
       • UC San Diego - $124,900
       
•	Would it be more beneficial to attend a private vs. a non-private university to earn more down the line?
Based on our findings related to private and non-private colleges/universities, there was no direct correlation between mid-career salary and investment (undergrad tuition/4-year degree). 

•	What specific field/major gives you the best long-term earning potential? 
We found that there was a significant difference between the pay scale of the top ten and bottom ten majors in 2015. The earnings for the top 10 majors were $175k-125k. The range for the bottom 10 were $40k-50k. The highest earning undergraduate degree was Petroleum Engineering ($175k). The lowest was Early Childhood Education ($40k).

•	Does a higher tuition cost guarantee a greater ROI?
Lastly, based on our return on investment (ROI) data, we’ve come to the conclusion that even if you attend a college/university with a higher earning entry-level salary, doesn’t mean you’ll have a higher ROI in the long-run. This is also true for private and ivy-league universities.
